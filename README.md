# 🧠 QuizMeAssembly - MIPS Assembly Quiz Game

A simple terminal-style quiz game created in **MIPS Assembly** using the **MARS simulator**. Designed as a finals project to demonstrate basic logic, input/output, and branching.

## 📚 Description

This is a multiple-choice quiz game that runs in the MARS simulator. It asks the user questions, checks the answers, tracks the score, and gives feedback.

Built to meet our finals lab exam requirements:

- ✅ Uses user input
- ✅ Implements branching and jump instructions
- ✅ Solves a problem (learn while having fun!)

## 🧠 Features

- Multiple-choice format
- User input via console
- Score tracking
- Feedback on correct/wrong answers
- Written fully in MIPS Assembly
